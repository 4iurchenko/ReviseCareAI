There are maybe a couple of nurses and doctor that are very nice, but overall the majority are very unprofessional. The place is very disgusting. It's supposed to be sanitary, it's a hospital, and it's not When I went, they made us use the same toilet, I told them several times that it was all clogged up and the girls in the front were you register? Didn't even care, so each person who had to go in had to go to the bathroom in the same clogged toilet that was not flushing, then the water fountain was absolutely disgusting. Now, for the most disgusting part, my daughter, which rushed to emergency, and she was bleeding, had no idea what was wrong, an uncaring uncompassionate. Nurse decided to tell her that it could be a miscarriage. Been the most disgusting thing that she could possibly tell her asked her blood pressure is spiking, and she's so upset in everything that Look at it this way, if you're having a miscarriage, then that means that you can still have kids.

Awesome! I called him the Vampire of Vibra. And for some reason a pulmonologist visited everyday even though nothing was wrong with my lungs.

Despite mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance after speaking with Clinical Liaison Michelle Zhao.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital felt eerie, and I was initially placed in a room with unsuitable roommates. The hospital seemed a little rundown and a lot of equipment seemed outdated. After raising my concerns with the supervisor nurse, Heather, I was moved to a more appropriate room, although it was initially bare and lacked basic amenities.\n\nA major issue arose with a male nurse who was unprofessional during wound care, prioritizing taking a photo of my wound over patient privacy (name unknown, Indian man with manbun). Heather promptly addressed this by assigning a more competent nurse and adjusting my uncomfortable bed.\n\nThe situation improved from Saturday onwards with better nursing care and professionalism, despite some confinement to my room over the weekend. My doctor, Dr. Tran, was rarely seen and not very helpful. Wound care varied, with some staff being excellent and others less so. (Male nurse name unknown, very personable, his supervisor not so much)\n\nThe worst part of my stay occurred on the second-to-last night with a nurse who mishandled my IV medication and seemed to lack basic nursing knowledge. Fortunately, the supervisor intervened, and I was assigned a more capable nurse (Natalia).\n\nOn my final day, I was unexpectedly moved to a shared room with poor conditions, leading to my early departure. This move was poorly managed, with little communication and no follow-up from doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Select Specialty Hospital was disappointing, marked by mismanagement and lack of communication. Heather was a standout, providing excellent support throughout.\n\nI will provide detailed ratings on various aspects of the hospital separately.\n\n•Nursing care: 6.5/10\n-Nurses that went above and beyond: Amal, Natalia, Pamela (another nurse, forgot her name said she was from east coast) and nursing supervisor Heather.\n•CNA care: 8/10\n“Honey” was the best CNA!\n•Wound care: 6/10\n•Hospital food: 6/10\n•Doctors: 5.5/10\n•Upper management: 5/10","author_name":"Isaac Vargas","translated":false,"language":"en","rating":3,"author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118001437358559279978/reviews","time":1720582296},{"profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIUc08sc-IeBy-3h7wOx0XRqIk0EyI8dlRYP9p2-XiGecNDAw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","original_language":"en","relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I spent 85 days at Select Specialty Hospital and am certain it was the right decision.

I was welcomed, respected, and thoroughly enjoyed my experiences with staff, from doctors, nurses, physical therapists, contracted dialysis, imaging, and wound care, CNAs, care managers, housekeeping, facilities, kitchen personnel, and the receptionist.

I’m eternally grateful for their kindness and great care they provided to care for him especially when he was struggling with his transfusion.  They were so compassionate and made sure many times there’s no mistakes, he’s comfortable, and answered any and every little question and concern we had with such patience and compassion.\n\nI was told by registration that typically the wait can be almost 5 hours so I would prepare to wait.   They had charging stations and many vending machines accommodating for not only regular drinks but energy drinks, coffee, and even sandwiches and light meals/snacks so I thought that was great.","author_name":"Karuna Cmt","translated":false,"language":"en","rating":5,"author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104137732899790093070/reviews","time":1717638590}],"3":"804","4":"Masked: 8016 Uktgxogx'k Rbv, Zka Isulj, EL 81156, HJB","5":"Masked: Rtpg Bfgsrcjm’y Xfshnotn - Omz Hlpla","6":"Masked: MvQHPJoYw8fI9NNBsaxb2PHFaac"},{"0":"OPERATIONAL","1":"3.5","2":[{"profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWVtIUNeOVQyQzskl-yEARZy5QzMttj0X_psHMcdDz2Cq4_lzTV=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","original_language":"en","relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"This was the best experience of my life and I've had surgeries in four major hospitals in California but this one was the best.

We contacted them and disputed the astronomical bill. The said it is not negotiable and we have to pay that. They charged over $2400 for ER service and said it's for administering medication and the ER bed. My wife did not use any bed and only sat on a chair. For medication administration, they gave her a couple of pills (charged separately) and a cup of water. $2400 for a cup of water and a chair?\nAfter a few weeks, we received a bill from another company called La Jolla Emergency Specialists for $868. They said this is the charge for the out-of-network doctor who was working at the ER room that night. The hospital did not mention to us that they have an out of network doctor.\nNo one should go through this again, and I highly encourage anyone who is considering this hospital, to avoid going there at all costs.

There are maybe a couple of nurses and doctor that are very nice, but overall the majority are very unprofessional. The place is very disgusting. It's supposed to be sanitary, it's a hospital, and it's not When I went, they made us use the same toilet, I told them several times that it was all clogged up and the girls in the front were you register? Didn't even care, so each person who had to go in had to go to the bathroom in the same clogged toilet that was not flushing, then the water fountain was absolutely disgusting. Now, for the most disgusting part, my daughter, which rushed to emergency, and she was bleeding, had no idea what was wrong, an uncaring uncompassionate. Nurse decided to tell her that it could be a miscarriage. Been the most disgusting thing that she could possibly tell her asked her blood pressure is spiking, and she's so upset in everything that Look at it this way, if you're having a miscarriage, then that means that you can still have kids. So her blood pressure spiked way up, and she was hysterical, this lady had no idea what her diagnosis should have never said anything. In fact, the baby is just fine, and so is she they never bother telling us that she had assist, and that she had a hemorrhage, the doctor did. I will be further going on after this. Not to mention now, here's my part. When I had passed out there because I was really sick. They treated me with nothing but disrespect. I accidentally had an accident and they wouldn't even give me pants until I was being discharged. I had to walk around with a towel. They didn't even give me a gown. They were unprofessional. They kept on making fun of me because I did pass out. They were yelling at me. They humiliated me and my daughter Shane. Unfortunately, these are the only hospitals that san diego provides so good luck.If you go and you're better off, at a doctor's office At least you know, half of them won't be on the phone, and they do care Oh, not to mention the security is also a joke. I videoed it a security. Was there for a good hour? Flirting? With the girls who should have been helping, and they weren't\nNot to mention, the waiting room is really gross.

Since she picked me up at pre op she made me feel safe. Knowing I was going to be under with her in the room, I knew she was taking care of me, along with Lindsay.

I waited in line to talk to a registration person and when it was my turn she never smiled and did not offer much help with my questions. I finally met with my daughter who was stuffed in a tiny room with a curtain in the middle that separated it for another patient. The nurse left my daughters stickers all over the room and never even used them for anything. She left the Epic chart open and left the room without locking the screen,  multiple times. I was able to read not only my information but clearly saw information for the other patient in the same room. The nursing team was obviously understaffed, my daughter hardly had attention and I never even saw a physician. We were there for almost 5 hours and she got 2 x-rays and some Tylenol that she couldn't swallow. The bill was over $9k . I called billing for an itemized bill and the line disconnected. I called the medical records/ ROI department a few weeks after to ask how I could obtain her records for my supplemental insurance and the guy on the phone was rude and seemed irritated that I was calling instead of trying to figure it out online.

Also, the nurse could not draw blood correctly. This head doctor does not believe that anything that happens to one part of the body can affect another part of the body. She does not believe that problems within the body is connected to each other. Meaning a high TSH is not connected to a high A1C. The two can be connected in various ways, especially if have a condition like anemia or lupus. She seems to make judgments based on how I looked. She left out and has not returned it has been 35 minutes now. Still waiting on an update. So still here at almost three o’clock. The IV in my arm was causing an allergic reaction, I told the doctor and the nurse at 2:14pm it’s now 2:58 pm.  She has now come to take the IV when I had already taken it out most of the way. The nurse then tells me that they are releasing me within anyone talking to me. This is pure racism at its finest here at UCSD Hillcrest. No one seems to be concerned about my diabetes, loss of appetite, fatigue, stiffness in both shoulders. Is this really good the standard of medical treatment here at UCSD. Attached is a picture of of IV before and after. The after picture is me removing the tape so my skin can breathe. Is this how they treat there long term patients or just black women in general? I am going to share this in as many place I can. I am sick of being discriminated against by same of the staff at UCSD ER in Hillcrest, San Diego, CA. I have had enough. Not every black person is violent or mean they just want to be treated like everyone else. They say that this is the best hospital in San Diego but they don’t mention that the hospital also has racial issues when it comes to black women.","10":"2024-10-04 22:14:04"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 774 P Rhaqz Uq, Bil Mvmpl, OX 64818, PBG","3":"Masked: Fldavysxb Igqcfuu Goigol hx PU Ybc Cxole Prywbm","4":"Masked: UhBU16C5QxPS7LQEpA8ok1QQGhS","5":"3.1","6":"477","7":"Masked: Aoly E","8":"4","9":"This is a very busy hospital but despite how busy it was, I feel I received excellent care.

Unfortunately, they have to work 12-hour days and are severely understaffed. It would've been great if someone had changed my bed the week I was there. But, no one did. One day my whole floor had only 2 RNs and 1 CNA!\n\nI was on a feeding tube, so I can't tell you about the food. But, I can tell you that somehow \"Diabetic\" was added to my chart even though I'm not diabetic. They put me through finger sticks every 4 hours anyway, and eventually realized I'm not diabetic just about the time I was transferred to another facility.\n\nThere was an oncologist who did his rounds after 11 PM. Awesome! I called him the Vampire of Vibra. And for some reason a pulmonologist visited everyday even though nothing was wrong with my lungs. He never examined me,  just asked how I was and billed my insurance.\n\nThere was one wonderful thing about Vibra. Their psychologist, Dr Yates is amazing. I love Dr Yates. He kept me sane by visiting me every single weekday.\n\nI almost forgot about Dr Brace. He was my attending physician while I was there. He's tall, dark, and handsome AND from Italy. Is he a good doctor? I think so. I just stared at him most of the time. It was hard to pay attention to what he said.

Despite mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance after speaking with Clinical Liaison Michelle Zhao.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital felt eerie, and I was initially placed in a room with unsuitable roommates. The hospital seemed a little rundown and a lot of equipment seemed outdated. After raising my concerns with the supervisor nurse, Heather, I was moved to a more appropriate room, although it was initially bare and lacked basic amenities.\n\nA major issue arose with a male nurse who was unprofessional during wound care, prioritizing taking a photo of my wound over patient privacy (name unknown, Indian man with manbun). Heather promptly addressed this by assigning a more competent nurse and adjusting my uncomfortable bed.\n\nThe situation improved from Saturday onwards with better nursing care and professionalism, despite some confinement to my room over the weekend. My doctor, Dr. Tran, was rarely seen and not very helpful. Wound care varied, with some staff being excellent and others less so. (Male nurse name unknown, very personable, his supervisor not so much)\n\nThe worst part of my stay occurred on the second-to-last night with a nurse who mishandled my IV medication and seemed to lack basic nursing knowledge. Fortunately, the supervisor intervened, and I was assigned a more capable nurse (Natalia).\n\nOn my final day, I was unexpectedly moved to a shared room with poor conditions, leading to my early departure. This move was poorly managed, with little communication and no follow-up from doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Select Specialty Hospital was disappointing, marked by mismanagement and lack of communication. Heather was a standout, providing excellent support throughout.\n\nI will provide detailed ratings on various aspects of the hospital separately.\n\n•Nursing care: 6.5/10\n-Nurses that went above and beyond: Amal, Natalia, Pamela (another nurse, forgot her name said she was from east coast) and nursing supervisor Heather.\n•CNA care: 8/10\n“Honey” was the best CNA!\n•Wound care: 6/10\n•Hospital food: 6/10\n•Doctors: 5.5/10\n•Upper management: 5/10","10":"2024-07-10 03:31:36"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 856 Kcmfxdbyvb Eh, Jtg Ykjly, TT 37319, DOG","3":"Masked: Jnzjou Ddrhbvviu Njgfysip - Sqi Llpyi","4":"Masked: XzPYSPbrow3Z8RQNshmdd0wS6dh","5":"4.0","6":"90","7":"Masked: Ivhzk H","8":"5","9":"I spent 85 days at Select Specialty Hospital and am certain it was the right decision. I chose Select based on their affiliation with Scripps. While there I was able to access my labs via Scripps’ portal, making it easier to read the results and discuss them with my doctor.\nIn all honesty, I was initially hesitant about my stay as the hospital rooms are a bit outdated: however, that was me judging a book by its cover as the Select staff put my mind at ease. I was welcomed, respected, and thoroughly enjoyed my experiences with staff, from doctors, nurses, physical therapists, contracted dialysis, imaging, and wound care, CNAs, care managers, housekeeping, facilities, kitchen personnel, and the receptionist. (Whew! I think I included everyone.)\nMore specifically, M******e from the kitchen, who personally went room to room to take food orders from patients, was a breeze to work with considering my many diet restrictions. M******e was thoughtful, considerate, dutiful, and interaction with her was a highlight to my day.\nN*****a with physical therapy was an enthusiastic source of encouragement. While in her care, she cheered me on and stayed positive, both of which are important factors in keeping patients motivated — me especially.\nThe nurses and CNAs made an incredible impact during a long stay such as mine (85 days).\nNurse shout out: S**e, A**l, T******d, F***z, A****e, D****l, R**e, M*****a, T****a, R***n, M***o, N*****a, F***i, V***y, S**a, K****y, E****n, B*****k, J****y, I*n, M*a!\nCNA shout out: Kuya T*m, I**a, G***a, J**n, R**a, A***r, S***y, R****a, R*****a, S*****a!\nTransitioning into life after discharge hasn’t been seamless in terms of setting up in-home care, but hey, considering all the working pieces, it’s understandable.\n\nWould I recommend?

The hospital did not provide any prior estimate for the simple service we received. After a week or so, we received a bill for over $2900 from which we have to pay over $2400. We contacted them and disputed the astronomical bill. The said it is not negotiable and we have to pay that. They charged over $2400 for ER service and said it's for administering medication and the ER bed. My wife did not use any bed and only sat on a chair. For medication administration, they gave her a couple of pills (charged separately) and a cup of water. $2400 for a cup of water and a chair?\nAfter a few weeks, we received a bill from another company called La Jolla Emergency Specialists for $868. They said this is the charge for the out-of-network doctor who was working at the ER room that night. The hospital did not mention to us that they have an out of network doctor.\nNo one should go through this again, and I highly encourage anyone who is considering this hospital, to avoid going there at all costs. They do not provide you with an estimate at the beginning and then they charge you astronomical amounts for the most simple things (remember $2400 for using a chair and a cup of water).  They do not tell you that they have out-of-network doctors and then you will receive two bills.\nTalking with them is totally useless too. So, the best way is to avoid them completely if you don't want to be ripped of by this hospital and their contractor doctors.","10":"2024-08-22 18:24:52"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 7310 Cyprger Xhp, Sd Glxmn, QQ 06805, PUE","3":"Masked: Yfhmqjc Edjxfssv Nmcjeetz Bd Lozrh","4":"Masked: MsWHI6a3cg9O2KVBeKf6Y6cQP4N","5":"3.5","6":"454","7":"Masked: Huhcu Mniphp","8":"1","9":"Worst hospital ever.

I found out they were giving her psych meds and morphine, knowing she has kidney disease and can not pass meds through her system like the average person. My mom has no previous mental problems. I asked the Dr. to stop , (the only Dr. that seemed to care). He agreed and my mom got better over the next couple days. Then when she was being discharged to skilled nursing they gave her psych meds again before leaving. Now she is confused again and doesn’t know where she is. She was on floor 7.

She stated that her breathing was normal. A few hours after my husband noticed her breathing to get worst. We called the nurse again and she stated that it was normal and babies who have problems would typically turn blue. In this case she was fine. At 2am in the morning we called the nurse because her breathing was extremely rapid and she was choking. They sent my baby to a observation room who sent her to the ICU intense unit. My baby was in the ICU hospital for almost 10 days! My baby could have died if it wasn’t for my husband and I who caught her rapid breathing. The nurses are extremely rude and unprofessional and careless who are there for a paycheck and not because they love their job. I filed a formal complaint with the floor manager and management because I fear this will happen to another mama and baby. I will never ever deliver at this hospital or recommend this place. It’s a very dangerous place to deliver a baby probably worst than a clinic. I’m extremely traumatized from this experience and am seeking mental counseling. My baby came out of the hospital with a broken collar bone from which they don’t know how she got.

She treated us as if we were children. First, she yelled at us asking if we didn't understand that Jose had COVID for 17 days and with 2 negative tests, if that was the case, she could have done it to him. She yelled at me so many times and in front of an employee inside the camper who told her to shut up and she didn't. To help her, give her some training and mental help. She is Philippine and I took my papers from her that she didn't want and so we returned to the office.

When it comes to getting admitted from the ER, what a miserable process. I had a ruptured appendix and bacterial infection. I was lied to, to be convinced to go to a much worse and more packed room, I was seen by nothing but residents (student doctors) and after countless times to speak to an Attendee (lead doctors) I was given every excuse in the world why I couldn't see them. I self-discharged myself AMA (Against medical advice) since I saw this wasn't going anywhere after almost 2 weeks of losing work, not progressing to the extent they swore I was, and no one having an answer other than blaming others. Because I left AMA, they also refused to help with pain management for my Ruptured Appendix so I left with a bag full of Antibiotics and Steroids. The nurses (literally all but one) were amazing! Sweet, charismatic, and honest. But dealing with just about everyone else was a disaster. I truly feel like the level of \"Care\" here has heavily switched from actually Caring for a Patient to Keeping the patient monitored and \"managed\" with no real desire to help them progress, and it's a shame living through it and watching other Veterans fall victim to the same.","10":"2024-09-15 15:57:14"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 8743 Hf Mehde Tdlxufd Bh, Imn Yddnp, JF 75819, NAY","3":"Masked: BE Vzmrbtd Xuzewg-Mxy Ylbfv","4":"Masked: JhJTk9maJxNI3ZFN21oTe9s8bM6","5":"3.4","6":"73","7":"Masked: Gfhswr","8":"1","9":"I've had repeated encounters with mental health providers from the Aspire center who engage in clinical malpractice to include Dr. Pape, who laughed and lied about my personal experiences & Dr Jessica Bolton.

She treated us as if we were children. First, she yelled at us asking if we didn't understand that Jose had COVID for 17 days and with 2 negative tests, if that was the case, she could have done it to him.

I asked why are you searching me again, he said we're checking for weapons,, I gave them my pepper spray when I came in.

This is NOT a hospital. It's an acute care facility. Very different. I was there a week recovering from cancer surgery. Most of the nurses were great. Unfortunately, they have to work 12-hour days and are severely understaffed. It would've been great if someone had changed my bed the week I was there. But, no one did. One day my whole floor had only 2 RNs and 1 CNA!\n\nI was on a feeding tube, so I can't tell you about the food. But, I can tell you that somehow \"Diabetic\" was added to my chart even though I'm not diabetic. They put me through finger sticks every 4 hours anyway, and eventually realized I'm not diabetic just about the time I was transferred to another facility.\n\nThere was an oncologist who did his rounds after 11 PM. Awesome! I called him the Vampire of Vibra. And for some reason a pulmonologist visited everyday even though nothing was wrong with my lungs. He never examined me,  just asked how I was and billed my insurance.\n\nThere was one wonderful thing about Vibra. Their psychologist, Dr Yates is amazing. I love Dr Yates.

The nurses are careless and extremely inexperienced. I delivered a beautiful baby girl. In the recovery room I asked the nurse to send the doctor since my baby breathing was rapid. She stated that her breathing was normal. A few hours after my husband noticed her breathing to get worst. We called the nurse again and she stated that it was normal and babies who have problems would typically turn blue. In this case she was fine. At 2am in the morning we called the nurse because her breathing was extremely rapid and she was choking. They sent my baby to a observation room who sent her to the ICU intense unit. My baby was in the ICU hospital for almost 10 days! My baby could have died if it wasn’t for my husband and I who caught her rapid breathing. The nurses are extremely rude and unprofessional and careless who are there for a paycheck and not because they love their job. I filed a formal complaint with the floor manager and management because I fear this will happen to another mama and baby. I will never ever deliver at this hospital or recommend this place. It’s a very dangerous place to deliver a baby probably worst than a clinic. I’m extremely traumatized from this experience and am seeking mental counseling. My baby came out of the hospital with a broken collar bone from which they don’t know how she got. My poor baby had her first days fighting for her life because of these monsters this whole thing could have been avoided!

Sweet, charismatic, and honest. But dealing with just about everyone else was a disaster. I truly feel like the level of \"Care\" here has heavily switched from actually Caring for a Patient to Keeping the patient monitored and \"managed\" with no real desire to help them progress, and it's a shame living through it and watching other Veterans fall victim to the same.","11":"2024-09-15 15:57:14"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 5333 Af Oxzxt Utjkhlk Ae, Ndc Qyxbi, TH 08100, TRN","3":"Masked: OE Mqsuvak Nwghrs-Xui Krwqz","4":"Masked: MuEAb6hzUjCN0DRS94nAh5n6vB6","5":"3.4","6":"73","7":"Masked: Lkfpya","9":"1","10":"I've had repeated encounters with mental health providers from the Aspire center who engage in clinical malpractice to include Dr. Pape, who laughed and lied about my personal experiences & Dr Jessica Bolton.

This time the doctor in charge wanted to tell me about her degrees. If she has these degrees then she should know every patient needs and medical issues are not the same. Also, the nurse could not draw blood correctly. This head doctor does not believe that anything that happens to one part of the body can affect another part of the body. She does not believe that problems within the body is connected to each other. Meaning a high TSH is not connected to a high A1C. The two can be connected in various ways, especially if have a condition like anemia or lupus. She seems to make judgments based on how I looked. She left out and has not returned it has been 35 minutes now. Still waiting on an update. So still here at almost three o’clock. The IV in my arm was causing an allergic reaction, I told the doctor and the nurse at 2:14pm it’s now 2:58 pm.  She has now come to take the IV when I had already taken it out most of the way. The nurse then tells me that they are releasing me within anyone talking to me. This is pure racism at its finest here at UCSD Hillcrest. No one seems to be concerned about my diabetes, loss of appetite, fatigue, stiffness in both shoulders. Is this really good the standard of medical treatment here at UCSD. Attached is a picture of of IV before and after. The after picture is me removing the tape so my skin can breathe. Is this how they treat there long term patients or just black women in general? I am going to share this in as many place I can. I am sick of being discriminated against by same of the staff at UCSD ER in Hillcrest, San Diego, CA. I have had enough.

We contacted them and disputed the astronomical bill. The said it is not negotiable and we have to pay that. They charged over $2400 for ER service and said it's for administering medication and the ER bed. My wife did not use any bed and only sat on a chair. For medication administration, they gave her a couple of pills (charged separately) and a cup of water. $2400 for a cup of water and a chair?\nAfter a few weeks, we received a bill from another company called La Jolla Emergency Specialists for $868. They said this is the charge for the out-of-network doctor who was working at the ER room that night. The hospital did not mention to us that they have an out of network doctor.\nNo one should go through this again, and I highly encourage anyone who is considering this hospital, to avoid going there at all costs. They do not provide you with an estimate at the beginning and then they charge you astronomical amounts for the most simple things (remember $2400 for using a chair and a cup of water).  They do not tell you that they have out-of-network doctors and then you will receive two bills.\nTalking with them is totally useless too.

I asked the Dr. to stop , (the only Dr. that seemed to care). He agreed and my mom got better over the next couple days. Then when she was being discharged to skilled nursing they gave her psych meds again before leaving. Now she is confused again and doesn’t know where she is. She was on floor 7.

Despite mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance after speaking with Clinical Liaison Michelle Zhao.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital felt eerie, and I was initially placed in a room with unsuitable roommates. The hospital seemed a little rundown and a lot of equipment seemed outdated. After raising my concerns with the supervisor nurse, Heather, I was moved to a more appropriate room, although it was initially bare and lacked basic amenities.\n\nA major issue arose with a male nurse who was unprofessional during wound care, prioritizing taking a photo of my wound over patient privacy (name unknown, Indian man with manbun). Heather promptly addressed this by assigning a more competent nurse and adjusting my uncomfortable bed.\n\nThe situation improved from Saturday onwards with better nursing care and professionalism, despite some confinement to my room over the weekend. My doctor, Dr. Tran, was rarely seen and not very helpful. Wound care varied, with some staff being excellent and others less so. (Male nurse name unknown, very personable, his supervisor not so much)\n\nThe worst part of my stay occurred on the second-to-last night with a nurse who mishandled my IV medication and seemed to lack basic nursing knowledge. Fortunately, the supervisor intervened, and I was assigned a more capable nurse (Natalia).\n\nOn my final day, I was unexpectedly moved to a shared room with poor conditions, leading to my early departure. This move was poorly managed, with little communication and no follow-up from doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Select Specialty Hospital was disappointing, marked by mismanagement and lack of communication. Heather was a standout, providing excellent support throughout.\n\nI will provide detailed ratings on various aspects of the hospital separately.\n\n•Nursing care: 6.5/10\n-Nurses that went above and beyond: Amal, Natalia, Pamela (another nurse, forgot her name said she was from east coast) and nursing supervisor Heather.\n•CNA care: 8/10\n“Honey” was the best CNA!\n•Wound care: 6/10\n•Hospital food: 6/10\n•Doctors: 5.5/10\n•Upper management: 5/10","11":"2024-07-10 03:31:36"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 660 Ysajjuqidy Xi, Tpb Cmzhz, ZB 66141, TYD","3":"Masked: Pjbswg Dforymqta Adhqfxvt - Bts Ajnfl","4":"Masked: LxZNPRolsj6U9KNVlytlr7gA6wn","5":"4.0","6":"90","7":"Masked: Yuygo U","9":"5","10":"I spent 85 days at Select Specialty Hospital and am certain it was the right decision. I chose Select based on their affiliation with Scripps. While there I was able to access my labs via Scripps’ portal, making it easier to read the results and discuss them with my doctor.\nIn all honesty, I was initially hesitant about my stay as the hospital rooms are a bit outdated: however, that was me judging a book by its cover as the Select staff put my mind at ease. I was welcomed, respected, and thoroughly enjoyed my experiences with staff, from doctors, nurses, physical therapists, contracted dialysis, imaging, and wound care, CNAs, care managers, housekeeping, facilities, kitchen personnel, and the receptionist. (Whew! I think I included everyone.)\nMore specifically, M******e from the kitchen, who personally went room to room to take food orders from patients, was a breeze to work with considering my many diet restrictions. M******e was thoughtful, considerate, dutiful, and interaction with her was a highlight to my day.\nN*****a with physical therapy was an enthusiastic source of encouragement. While in her care, she cheered me on and stayed positive, both of which are important factors in keeping patients motivated — me especially.\nThe nurses and CNAs made an incredible impact during a long stay such as mine (85 days).\nNurse shout out: S**e, A**l, T******d, F***z, A****e, D****l, R**e, M*****a, T****a, R***n, M***o, N*****a, F***i, V***y, S**a, K****y, E****n, B*****k, J****y, I*n, M*a!\nCNA shout out: Kuya T*m, I**a, G***a, J**n, R**a, A***r, S***y, R****a, R*****a, S*****a!\nTransitioning into life after discharge hasn’t been seamless in terms of setting up in-home care, but hey, considering all the working pieces, it’s understandable.\n\nWould I recommend?

Now, for the most disgusting part, my daughter, which rushed to emergency, and she was bleeding, had no idea what was wrong, an uncaring uncompassionate. Nurse decided to tell her that it could be a miscarriage.

I came to the ER room to meet up with her around midnight and NOBODY addressed me or seemed helpful. The security guards were unwelcoming and seemed irritated that they had to stop talking to each other. I waited in line to talk to a registration person and when it was my turn she never smiled and did not offer much help with my questions. I finally met with my daughter who was stuffed in a tiny room with a curtain in the middle that separated it for another patient. The nurse left my daughters stickers all over the room and never even used them for anything. She left the Epic chart open and left the room without locking the screen,  multiple times. I was able to read not only my information but clearly saw information for the other patient in the same room. The nursing team was obviously understaffed, my daughter hardly had attention and I never even saw a physician. We were there for almost 5 hours and she got 2 x-rays and some Tylenol that she couldn't swallow. The bill was over $9k . I called billing for an itemized bill and the line disconnected. I called the medical records/ ROI department a few weeks after to ask how I could obtain her records for my supplemental insurance and the guy on the phone was rude and seemed irritated that I was calling instead of trying to figure it out online. After the conversation I thanked him and said goodbye and he did not even reciprocate, he literally mumbled something. This place is awful. Not a good experience in any way. The administration should be ashamed. This place is in desperate need of basic customer service training across the board.","11":"2024-07-17 22:07:56"}],"schema":[{"key":"0","name":"processing_date","type":"date"},{"key":"1","name":"hospital_status","type":"string"},{"key":"2","name":"hospital_address","type":"string"},{"key":"3","name":"hospital_name","type":"string"},{"key":"4","name":"hospital_place_id","type":"string"},{"key":"5","name":"hospital_avg_rating","type":"double"},{"key":"6","name":"hospital_rating_cnt","type":"bigint"},{"key":"7","name":"review_author","type":"string"},{"key":"8","name":"review_author_url","type":"string"},{"key":"9","name":"review_rating","type":"bigint"},{"key":"10","name":"review_text","type":"string"},{"key":"11","name":"review_time","type":"string"}],"truncated":false},"isSummary":false,"language":"scala","wranglerEntryContext":{"candidateVariableNames":["daily_reviews_df"],"dataframeType":"pyspark"}},"persist_state":{"view":{"type":"details","tableOptions":{},"chartOptions":{"chartType":"bar","categoryFieldKeys":["1"],"seriesFieldKeys":["5"],"aggregationType":"sum","isStacked":false,"binsNumber":10,"wordFrequency":"-1","evaluatesOverAllRecords":false}}}},"b6f5ecd9-a621-43e7-a8a4-16d68464c007":{"type":"Synapse.DataFrame","sync_state":{"table":{"rows":[{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 4462 Fpim Lel, Uil Jrzrz, TX 01253, VTD","3":"Masked: Vwmhcf Xcjyraeypa Apsa Ejklyio Dfzjmo","4":"Masked: BsQPd42_YeFL7KUSgEm4EqpKFld","5":"3.5","6":"336","7":"Masked: Leyfxloo Zeoda","9":"5","10":"Absolutely wonderful staff.\nFrom the moment i came in I was treated with the most empathetic care I’ve ever received.\nThe sweet woman who cleaned my wounds chatted with me like a friend.

Also, the nurse could not draw blood correctly. This head doctor does not believe that anything that happens to one part of the body can affect another part of the body. She does not believe that problems within the body is connected to each other. Meaning a high TSH is not connected to a high A1C. The two can be connected in various ways, especially if have a condition like anemia or lupus. She seems to make judgments based on how I looked. She left out and has not returned it has been 35 minutes now. Still waiting on an update. So still here at almost three o’clock. The IV in my arm was causing an allergic reaction, I told the doctor and the nurse at 2:14pm it’s now 2:58 pm.  She has now come to take the IV when I had already taken it out most of the way. The nurse then tells me that they are releasing me within anyone talking to me. This is pure racism at its finest here at UCSD Hillcrest. No one seems to be concerned about my diabetes, loss of appetite, fatigue, stiffness in both shoulders. Is this really good the standard of medical treatment here at UCSD. Attached is a picture of of IV before and after. The after picture is me removing the tape so my skin can breathe. Is this how they treat there long term patients or just black women in general? I am going to share this in as many place I can. I am sick of being discriminated against by same of the staff at UCSD ER in Hillcrest, San Diego, CA. I have had enough.

She stated that her breathing was normal. A few hours after my husband noticed her breathing to get worst. We called the nurse again and she stated that it was normal and babies who have problems would typically turn blue. In this case she was fine. At 2am in the morning we called the nurse because her breathing was extremely rapid and she was choking. They sent my baby to a observation room who sent her to the ICU intense unit. My baby was in the ICU hospital for almost 10 days! My baby could have died if it wasn’t for my husband and I who caught her rapid breathing. The nurses are extremely rude and unprofessional and careless who are there for a paycheck and not because they love their job. I filed a formal complaint with the floor manager and management because I fear this will happen to another mama and baby. I will never ever deliver at this hospital or recommend this place. It’s a very dangerous place to deliver a baby probably worst than a clinic. I’m extremely traumatized from this experience and am seeking mental counseling.

Didn't even care, so each person who had to go in had to go to the bathroom in the same clogged toilet that was not flushing, then the water fountain was absolutely disgusting. Now, for the most disgusting part, my daughter, which rushed to emergency, and she was bleeding, had no idea what was wrong, an uncaring uncompassionate. Nurse decided to tell her that it could be a miscarriage. Been the most disgusting thing that she could possibly tell her asked her blood pressure is spiking, and she's so upset in everything that Look at it this way, if you're having a miscarriage, then that means that you can still have kids. So her blood pressure spiked way up, and she was hysterical, this lady had no idea what her diagnosis should have never said anything. In fact, the baby is just fine, and so is she they never bother telling us that she had assist, and that she had a hemorrhage, the doctor did. I will be further going on after this. Not to mention now, here's my part. When I had passed out there because I was really sick. They treated me with nothing but disrespect. I accidentally had an accident and they wouldn't even give me pants until I was being discharged. I had to walk around with a towel. They didn't even give me a gown. They were unprofessional.

If you want information regarding a family member or want excellent care I absolutely DO NOT recommend this hospital. If I could rate it a zero I would.

I get called finally and I'm crying in one of the worst pains I've felt in my life and the nurse is checking my blood pressure ECT and I asked if I could get a CT scan of my head and she said they can't and proceeds to say \"well doesn't seem like in that much pain if your able to pick up and use your phone right,someone it pain like you say wouldnt be able to use a phone\" as I was texting a relative since I got dropped off because I couldn't drive. This was a older Mexican lady at that point I had to get up and leave and seek help I went to a sharp hospital which was great and got the care I needed. I felt so belittled there and the fact that I was in so much pain and had to get up and leave like that in the condition I was in was the worst part.

Despite mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance after speaking with Clinical Liaison Michelle Zhao.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital felt eerie, and I was initially placed in a room with unsuitable roommates. The hospital seemed a little rundown and a lot of equipment seemed outdated. After raising my concerns with the supervisor nurse, Heather, I was moved to a more appropriate room, although it was initially bare and lacked basic amenities.\n\nA major issue arose with a male nurse who was unprofessional during wound care, prioritizing taking a photo of my wound over patient privacy (name unknown, Indian man with manbun). Heather promptly addressed this by assigning a more competent nurse and adjusting my uncomfortable bed.\n\nThe situation improved from Saturday onwards with better nursing care and professionalism, despite some confinement to my room over the weekend. My doctor, Dr. Tran, was rarely seen and not very helpful. Wound care varied, with some staff being excellent and others less so. (Male nurse name unknown, very personable, his supervisor not so much)\n\nThe worst part of my stay occurred on the second-to-last night with a nurse who mishandled my IV medication and seemed to lack basic nursing knowledge. Fortunately, the supervisor intervened, and I was assigned a more capable nurse (Natalia).\n\nOn my final day, I was unexpectedly moved to a shared room with poor conditions, leading to my early departure. This move was poorly managed, with little communication and no follow-up from doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Select Specialty Hospital was disappointing, marked by mismanagement and lack of communication. Heather was a standout, providing excellent support throughout.\n\nI will provide detailed ratings on various aspects of the hospital separately.\n\n•Nursing care: 6.5/10\n-Nurses that went above and beyond: Amal, Natalia, Pamela (another nurse, forgot her name said she was from east coast) and nursing supervisor Heather.\n•CNA care: 8/10\n“Honey” was the best CNA!\n•Wound care: 6/10\n•Hospital food: 6/10\n•Doctors: 5.5/10\n•Upper management: 5/10","11":"2024-07-10 03:31:36"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 42664 Nxm Udzrkg Sx, Xfj Grqzr, XI 88078, JYG","3":"Masked: Tsads Eklrnse Tyzxxe","4":"Masked: PkPNC9hbJ4bT3OFNDiaqu8ZZS0c","5":"3.2","6":"414","7":"Masked: Kwn Wpna Cravzl","9":"1","10":"My brothers and sister, if you have real shit real life emergency just look up on YouTube what to do.

Before he came in the security searched me again including making me turn my pockets out. I asked why are you searching me again, he said we're checking for weapons,, I gave them my pepper spray when I came in. I asked why am I being searched through my pockets what exactly do you think I have? The doctor came in and proceeded to yell at me, I asked him why he's yelling at me he said I yelled at him and interrupted him which I did not.

The hospital did not provide any prior estimate for the simple service we received. After a week or so, we received a bill for over $2900 from which we have to pay over $2400. We contacted them and disputed the astronomical bill. The said it is not negotiable and we have to pay that. They charged over $2400 for ER service and said it's for administering medication and the ER bed. My wife did not use any bed and only sat on a chair. For medication administration, they gave her a couple of pills (charged separately) and a cup of water. $2400 for a cup of water and a chair?\nAfter a few weeks, we received a bill from another company called La Jolla Emergency Specialists for $868. They said this is the charge for the out-of-network doctor who was working at the ER room that night. The hospital did not mention to us that they have an out of network doctor.\nNo one should go through this again, and I highly encourage anyone who is considering this hospital, to avoid going there at all costs. They do not provide you with an estimate at the beginning and then they charge you astronomical amounts for the most simple things (remember $2400 for using a chair and a cup of water).  They do not tell you that they have out-of-network doctors and then you will receive two bills.\nTalking with them is totally useless too. So, the best way is to avoid them completely if you don't want to be ripped of by this hospital and their contractor doctors.","11":"2024-08-22 18:24:52"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 6832 Xihic Xfu, Qay Lrpuj, WB 54184, JTH","3":"Masked: Lvvvqem Xvgnx Vxnmqods Ryy Vrgtu","4":"Masked: VbPWM3bQVomN9KUEclajG0mTubh","5":"3.2","6":"601","7":"Masked: Vvwi Nveqc","9":"5","10":"My mom was recently admitted to the hospital.

Sweet, charismatic, and honest. But dealing with just about everyone else was a disaster.

The security guards were unwelcoming and seemed irritated that they had to stop talking to each other. I waited in line to talk to a registration person and when it was my turn she never smiled and did not offer much help with my questions. I finally met with my daughter who was stuffed in a tiny room with a curtain in the middle that separated it for another patient. The nurse left my daughters stickers all over the room and never even used them for anything. She left the Epic chart open and left the room without locking the screen,  multiple times. I was able to read not only my information but clearly saw information for the other patient in the same room. The nursing team was obviously understaffed, my daughter hardly had attention and I never even saw a physician. We were there for almost 5 hours and she got 2 x-rays and some Tylenol that she couldn't swallow. The bill was over $9k . I called billing for an itemized bill and the line disconnected. I called the medical records/ ROI department a few weeks after to ask how I could obtain her records for my supplemental insurance and the guy on the phone was rude and seemed irritated that I was calling instead of trying to figure it out online. After the conversation I thanked him and said goodbye and he did not even reciprocate, he literally mumbled something. This place is awful. Not a good experience in any way.

One day my whole floor had only 2 RNs and 1 CNA!\n\nI was on a feeding tube, so I can't tell you about the food. But, I can tell you that somehow \"Diabetic\" was added to my chart even though I'm not diabetic. They put me through finger sticks every 4 hours anyway, and eventually realized I'm not diabetic just about the time I was transferred to another facility.\n\nThere was an oncologist who did his rounds after 11 PM. Awesome! I called him the Vampire of Vibra. And for some reason a pulmonologist visited everyday even though nothing was wrong with my lungs. He never examined me,  just asked how I was and billed my insurance.\n\nThere was one wonderful thing about Vibra. Their psychologist, Dr Yates is amazing. I love Dr Yates. He kept me sane by visiting me every single weekday.\n\nI almost forgot about Dr Brace. He was my attending physician while I was there. He's tall, dark, and handsome AND from Italy. Is he a good doctor? I think so. I just stared at him most of the time. It was hard to pay attention to what he said.

This time the doctor in charge wanted to tell me about her degrees. If she has these degrees then she should know every patient needs and medical issues are not the same. Also, the nurse could not draw blood correctly. This head doctor does not believe that anything that happens to one part of the body can affect another part of the body. She does not believe that problems within the body is connected to each other. Meaning a high TSH is not connected to a high A1C. The two can be connected in various ways, especially if have a condition like anemia or lupus. She seems to make judgments based on how I looked. She left out and has not returned it has been 35 minutes now. Still waiting on an update. So still here at almost three o’clock. The IV in my arm was causing an allergic reaction, I told the doctor and the nurse at 2:14pm it’s now 2:58 pm.  She has now come to take the IV when I had already taken it out most of the way. The nurse then tells me that they are releasing me within anyone talking to me. This is pure racism at its finest here at UCSD Hillcrest. No one seems to be concerned about my diabetes, loss of appetite, fatigue, stiffness in both shoulders. Is this really good the standard of medical treatment here at UCSD. Attached is a picture of of IV before and after. The after picture is me removing the tape so my skin can breathe. Is this how they treat there long term patients or just black women in general? I am going to share this in as many place I can. I am sick of being discriminated against by same of the staff at UCSD ER in Hillcrest, San Diego, CA. I have had enough.

She stated that her breathing was normal. A few hours after my husband noticed her breathing to get worst. We called the nurse again and she stated that it was normal and babies who have problems would typically turn blue. In this case she was fine. At 2am in the morning we called the nurse because her breathing was extremely rapid and she was choking. They sent my baby to a observation room who sent her to the ICU intense unit. My baby was in the ICU hospital for almost 10 days! My baby could have died if it wasn’t for my husband and I who caught her rapid breathing. The nurses are extremely rude and unprofessional and careless who are there for a paycheck and not because they love their job. I filed a formal complaint with the floor manager and management because I fear this will happen to another mama and baby. I will never ever deliver at this hospital or recommend this place. It’s a very dangerous place to deliver a baby probably worst than a clinic. I’m extremely traumatized from this experience and am seeking mental counseling.

Now, for the most disgusting part, my daughter, which rushed to emergency, and she was bleeding, had no idea what was wrong, an uncaring uncompassionate. Nurse decided to tell her that it could be a miscarriage. Been the most disgusting thing that she could possibly tell her asked her blood pressure is spiking, and she's so upset in everything that Look at it this way, if you're having a miscarriage, then that means that you can still have kids. So her blood pressure spiked way up, and she was hysterical, this lady had no idea what her diagnosis should have never said anything. In fact, the baby is just fine, and so is she they never bother telling us that she had assist, and that she had a hemorrhage, the doctor did. I will be further going on after this.

I get called finally and I'm crying in one of the worst pains I've felt in my life and the nurse is checking my blood pressure ECT and I asked if I could get a CT scan of my head and she said they can't and proceeds to say \"well doesn't seem like in that much pain if your able to pick up and use your phone right,someone it pain like you say wouldnt be able to use a phone\" as I was texting a relative since I got dropped off because I couldn't drive. This was a older Mexican lady at that point I had to get up and leave and seek help I went to a sharp hospital which was great and got the care I needed.

Despite mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance after speaking with Clinical Liaison Michelle Zhao.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital felt eerie, and I was initially placed in a room with unsuitable roommates. The hospital seemed a little rundown and a lot of equipment seemed outdated. After raising my concerns with the supervisor nurse, Heather, I was moved to a more appropriate room, although it was initially bare and lacked basic amenities.\n\nA major issue arose with a male nurse who was unprofessional during wound care, prioritizing taking a photo of my wound over patient privacy (name unknown, Indian man with manbun). Heather promptly addressed this by assigning a more competent nurse and adjusting my uncomfortable bed.\n\nThe situation improved from Saturday onwards with better nursing care and professionalism, despite some confinement to my room over the weekend. My doctor, Dr. Tran, was rarely seen and not very helpful. Wound care varied, with some staff being excellent and others less so. (Male nurse name unknown, very personable, his supervisor not so much)\n\nThe worst part of my stay occurred on the second-to-last night with a nurse who mishandled my IV medication and seemed to lack basic nursing knowledge. Fortunately, the supervisor intervened, and I was assigned a more capable nurse (Natalia).\n\nOn my final day, I was unexpectedly moved to a shared room with poor conditions, leading to my early departure. This move was poorly managed, with little communication and no follow-up from doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Select Specialty Hospital was disappointing, marked by mismanagement and lack of communication. Heather was a standout, providing excellent support throughout.\n\nI will provide detailed ratings on various aspects of the hospital separately.\n\n•Nursing care: 6.5/10\n-Nurses that went above and beyond: Amal, Natalia, Pamela (another nurse, forgot her name said she was from east coast) and nursing supervisor Heather.\n•CNA care: 8/10\n“Honey” was the best CNA!\n•Wound care: 6/10\n•Hospital food: 6/10\n•Doctors: 5.5/10\n•Upper management: 5/10","11":"2024-07-10 03:31:36"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 42664 Nxm Udzrkg Sx, Xfj Grqzr, XI 88078, JYG","3":"Masked: Tsads Eklrnse Tyzxxe","4":"Masked: PkPNC9hbJ4bT3OFNDiaqu8ZZS0c","5":"3.2","6":"414","7":"Masked: Kwn Wpna Cravzl","9":"1","10":"My brothers and sister, if you have real shit real life emergency just look up on YouTube what to do.

They were so compassionate and made sure many times there’s no mistakes, he’s comfortable, and answered any and every little question and concern we had with such patience and compassion.\n\nI was told by registration that typically the wait can be almost 5 hours so I would prepare to wait.

Before he came in the security searched me again including making me turn my pockets out. I asked why are you searching me again, he said we're checking for weapons,, I gave them my pepper spray when I came in. I asked why am I being searched through my pockets what exactly do you think I have? The doctor came in and proceeded to yell at me, I asked him why he's yelling at me he said I yelled at him and interrupted him which I did not.

The hospital did not provide any prior estimate for the simple service we received. After a week or so, we received a bill for over $2900 from which we have to pay over $2400. We contacted them and disputed the astronomical bill. The said it is not negotiable and we have to pay that. They charged over $2400 for ER service and said it's for administering medication and the ER bed. My wife did not use any bed and only sat on a chair. For medication administration, they gave her a couple of pills (charged separately) and a cup of water. $2400 for a cup of water and a chair?\nAfter a few weeks, we received a bill from another company called La Jolla Emergency Specialists for $868. They said this is the charge for the out-of-network doctor who was working at the ER room that night. The hospital did not mention to us that they have an out of network doctor.\nNo one should go through this again, and I highly encourage anyone who is considering this hospital, to avoid going there at all costs. They do not provide you with an estimate at the beginning and then they charge you astronomical amounts for the most simple things (remember $2400 for using a chair and a cup of water).  They do not tell you that they have out-of-network doctors and then you will receive two bills.\nTalking with them is totally useless too. So, the best way is to avoid them completely if you don't want to be ripped of by this hospital and their contractor doctors.","11":"2024-08-22 18:24:52"},{"0":"2024-10-28","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked: 6832 Xihic Xfu, Qay Lrpuj, WB 54184, JTH","3":"Masked: Lvvvqem Xvgnx Vxnmqods Ryy Vrgtu","4":"Masked: VbPWM3bQVomN9KUEclajG0mTubh","5":"3.2","6":"601","7":"Masked: Vvwi Nveqc","9":"5","10":"My mom was recently admitted to the hospital.

Sweet, charismatic, and honest. But dealing with just about everyone else was a disaster.

I came to the ER room to meet up with her around midnight and NOBODY addressed me or seemed helpful. The security guards were unwelcoming and seemed irritated that they had to stop talking to each other. I waited in line to talk to a registration person and when it was my turn she never smiled and did not offer much help with my questions. I finally met with my daughter who was stuffed in a tiny room with a curtain in the middle that separated it for another patient. The nurse left my daughters stickers all over the room and never even used them for anything. She left the Epic chart open and left the room without locking the screen,  multiple times. I was able to read not only my information but clearly saw information for the other patient in the same room. The nursing team was obviously understaffed, my daughter hardly had attention and I never even saw a physician. We were there for almost 5 hours and she got 2 x-rays and some Tylenol that she couldn't swallow. The bill was over $9k . I called billing for an itemized bill and the line disconnected. I called the medical records/ ROI department a few weeks after to ask how I could obtain her records for my supplemental insurance and the guy on the phone was rude and seemed irritated that I was calling instead of trying to figure it out online. After the conversation I thanked him and said goodbye and he did not even reciprocate, he literally mumbled something. This place is awful. Not a good experience in any way.

One day my whole floor had only 2 RNs and 1 CNA!\n\nI was on a feeding tube, so I can't tell you about the food. But, I can tell you that somehow \"Diabetic\" was added to my chart even though I'm not diabetic. They put me through finger sticks every 4 hours anyway, and eventually realized I'm not diabetic just about the time I was transferred to another facility.\n\nThere was an oncologist who did his rounds after 11 PM. Awesome! I called him the Vampire of Vibra. And for some reason a pulmonologist visited everyday even though nothing was wrong with my lungs. He never examined me,  just asked how I was and billed my insurance.\n\nThere was one wonderful thing about Vibra. Their psychologist, Dr Yates is amazing. I love Dr Yates. He kept me sane by visiting me every single weekday.\n\nI almost forgot about Dr Brace. He was my attending physician while I was there. He's tall, dark, and handsome AND from Italy. Is he a good doctor? I think so. I just stared at him most of the time. It was hard to pay attention to what he said.
