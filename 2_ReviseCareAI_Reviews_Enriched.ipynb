They didn’t even take out my trash and I was rarely checked on. I seriously switched my coverage after this, the staff seemed lazy.

This time the doctor in charge wanted to tell me about her degrees. If she has these degrees then she should know every patient needs and medical issues are not the same. Also, the nurse could not draw blood correctly. This head doctor does not believe that anything that happens to one part of the body can affect another part of the body. She does not believe that problems within the body is connected to each other. Meaning a high TSH is not connected to a high A1C. The two can be connected in various ways, especially if have a condition like anemia or lupus. She seems to make judgments based on how I looked. She left out and has not returned it has been 35 minutes now. Still waiting on an update. So still here at almost three o’clock. The IV in my arm was causing an allergic reaction, I told the doctor and the nurse at 2:14pm it’s now 2:58 pm.  She has now come to take the IV when I had already taken it out most of the way. The nurse then tells me that they are releasing me within anyone talking to me. This is pure racism at its finest here at UCSD Hillcrest. No one seems to be concerned about my diabetes, loss of appetite, fatigue, stiffness in both shoulders. Is this really good the standard of medical treatment here at UCSD. Attached is a picture of of IV before and after. The after picture is me removing the tape so my skin can breathe. Is this how they treat there long term patients or just black women in general? I am going to share this in as many place I can. I am sick of being discriminated against by same of the staff at UCSD ER in Hillcrest, San Diego, CA. I have had enough.

We called the nurse again and she stated that it was normal and babies who have problems would typically turn blue. In this case she was fine. At 2am in the morning we called the nurse because her breathing was extremely rapid and she was choking. They sent my baby to a observation room who sent her to the ICU intense unit. My baby was in the ICU hospital for almost 10 days! My baby could have died if it wasn’t for my husband and I who caught her rapid breathing. The nurses are extremely rude and unprofessional and careless who are there for a paycheck and not because they love their job. I filed a formal complaint with the floor manager and management because I fear this will happen to another mama and baby. I will never ever deliver at this hospital or recommend this place. It’s a very dangerous place to deliver a baby probably worst than a clinic. I’m extremely traumatized from this experience and am seeking mental counseling.

Despite mixed reviews, I decided to give it a chance after speaking with Clinical Liaison Michelle Zhao.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital felt eerie, and I was initially placed in a room with unsuitable roommates. The hospital seemed a little rundown and a lot of equipment seemed outdated. After raising my concerns with the supervisor nurse, Heather, I was moved to a more appropriate room, although it was initially bare and lacked basic amenities.\n\nA major issue arose with a male nurse who was unprofessional during wound care, prioritizing taking a photo of my wound over patient privacy (name unknown, Indian man with manbun). Heather promptly addressed this by assigning a more competent nurse and adjusting my uncomfortable bed.\n\nThe situation improved from Saturday onwards with better nursing care and professionalism, despite some confinement to my room over the weekend. My doctor, Dr. Tran, was rarely seen and not very helpful. Wound care varied, with some staff being excellent and others less so. (Male nurse name unknown, very personable, his supervisor not so much)\n\nThe worst part of my stay occurred on the second-to-last night with a nurse who mishandled my IV medication and seemed to lack basic nursing knowledge. Fortunately, the supervisor intervened, and I was assigned a more capable nurse (Natalia).\n\nOn my final day, I was unexpectedly moved to a shared room with poor conditions, leading to my early departure. This move was poorly managed, with little communication and no follow-up from doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Select Specialty Hospital was disappointing, marked by mismanagement and lack of communication. Heather was a standout, providing excellent support throughout.\n\nI will provide detailed ratings on various aspects of the hospital separately.\n\n•Nursing care: 6.5/10\n-Nurses that went above and beyond: Amal, Natalia, Pamela (another nurse, forgot her name said she was from east coast) and nursing supervisor Heather.\n•CNA care: 8/10\n“Honey” was the best CNA!\n•Wound care: 6/10\n•Hospital food: 6/10\n•Doctors: 5.5/10\n•Upper management: 5/10","11":"2024-07-10 03:31:36"},{"0":"2024-10-29","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked:222 Ndrzxjwsqj As, Adj Gxlwq, FS 55388, OAS","3":"Masked:Alqlus Akluxdqsr Jqrkxsdq - Adj Gxlwq","4":"Masked:FzKKGOffdt3H5TSMbofqd2fG3lr","5":"4.0","6":"90","7":"Masked:Ixjjr Jxqq","8":"Masked:zsskr://fff.wqqwql.uqp/pdkr/uqjsnxm/338538525382885838888/nldxlfr","9":"5","10":"Physical therapy with Lilyanne was very professional yet conducive to want to do more when you see her come.

I chose Select based on their affiliation with Scripps. While there I was able to access my labs via Scripps’ portal, making it easier to read the results and discuss them with my doctor.\nIn all honesty, I was initially hesitant about my stay as the hospital rooms are a bit outdated: however, that was me judging a book by its cover as the Select staff put my mind at ease. I was welcomed, respected, and thoroughly enjoyed my experiences with staff, from doctors, nurses, physical therapists, contracted dialysis, imaging, and wound care, CNAs, care managers, housekeeping, facilities, kitchen personnel, and the receptionist. (Whew! I think I included everyone.)\nMore specifically, M******e from the kitchen, who personally went room to room to take food orders from patients, was a breeze to work with considering my many diet restrictions. M******e was thoughtful, considerate, dutiful, and interaction with her was a highlight to my day.\nN*****a with physical therapy was an enthusiastic source of encouragement. While in her care, she cheered me on and stayed positive, both of which are important factors in keeping patients motivated — me especially.\nThe nurses and CNAs made an incredible impact during a long stay such as mine (85 days).\nNurse shout out: S**e, A**l, T******d, F***z, A****e, D****l, R**e, M*****a, T****a, R***n, M***o, N*****a, F***i, V***y, S**a, K****y, E****n, B*****k, J****y, I*n, M*a!\nCNA shout out: Kuya T*m, I**a, G***a, J**n, R**a, A***r, S***y, R****a, R*****a, S*****a!\nTransitioning into life after discharge hasn’t been seamless in terms of setting up in-home care, but hey, considering all the working pieces, it’s understandable.\n\nWould I recommend?

This was incredibly insensitive and disrespectful, as we were all in a state of shock and sorrow. Furthermore, we were even asked to vacate the waiting room to make space for potential visitors.

I hope that this review will serve as a reminder to the hospital staff of the importance of empathy and sensitivity, particularly when dealing with families who have just experienced a loss.","11":"2024-08-26 22:39:46"},{"0":"2024-10-29","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked:8866 Sxfsz Sdl, Adj Gxlwq, FS 55388, OAS","3":"Masked:Aunxkkr Ilnur Jqrkxsdq Adj Gxlwq","4":"Masked:FzKKI3nKSskO5TSMqnnsF5pSwuf","5":"3.2","6":"602","7":"Masked:Jnw Tqwd","8":"Masked:zsskr://fff.wqqwql.uqp/pdkr/uqjsnxm/338525586788753563872/nldxlfr","9":"1","10":"My daughter was brought here by ambulance after a moderate car accident in which an airbag deployed in her face. I came to the ER room to meet up with her around midnight and NOBODY addressed me or seemed helpful. The security guards were unwelcoming and seemed irritated that they had to stop talking to each other. I waited in line to talk to a registration person and when it was my turn she never smiled and did not offer much help with my questions. I finally met with my daughter who was stuffed in a tiny room with a curtain in the middle that separated it for another patient. The nurse left my daughters stickers all over the room and never even used them for anything. She left the Epic chart open and left the room without locking the screen,  multiple times. I was able to read not only my information but clearly saw information for the other patient in the same room. The nursing team was obviously understaffed, my daughter hardly had attention and I never even saw a physician. We were there for almost 5 hours and she got 2 x-rays and some Tylenol that she couldn't swallow. The bill was over $9k . I called billing for an itemized bill and the line disconnected. I called the medical records/ ROI department a few weeks after to ask how I could obtain her records for my supplemental insurance and the guy on the phone was rude and seemed irritated that I was calling instead of trying to figure it out online. After the conversation I thanked him and said goodbye and he did not even reciprocate, he literally mumbled something. This place is awful. Not a good experience in any way. The administration should be ashamed. This place is in desperate need of basic customer service training across the board.","11":"2024-07-17 22:07:56"},{"0":"2024-10-29","1":"OPERATIONAL","2":"Masked:8866 Sxfsz Sdl, Adj Gxlwq, FS 55388, OAS","3":"Masked:Aunxkkr Ilnur Jqrkxsdq Adj Gxlwq","4":"Masked:FzKKI3nKSskO5TSMqnnsF5pSwuf","5":"3.2","6":"602","7":"Masked:Kxpljd Mdpxnlo","8":"Masked:zsskr://fff.wqqwql.uqp/pdkr/uqjsnxm/338858875538687538855/nldxlfr","9":"5","10":"I had surgery on 10/08.

Eric was my pre op nurse and he did a really good job prepping me for surgery. Ate Thelma was my surgical nurse and I just want to tell her the biggest thank you for taking care of me. Since she picked me up at pre op she made me feel safe. Knowing I was going to be under with her in the room, I knew she was taking care of me, along with Lindsay. Obviously dr Taller and dr Abhijith, my surgeon and anesthetist, did amazing and kept me safe and alive, which I’m very thankful for. I unfortunately and thankfully don’t remember my recovery nurse, that wasn’t my finest moment and my apologies. Post op was a breeze thanks to my nurses Fara, Daniel, Ceajay, Marygrace and Evelyn. This has been my only surgery and medical stay ever, this hospital has an amazing team that I appreciate a lot. I came in nervous and scared but it stopped the second I met these people. I’m deeply grateful for the care I received.\n\nThe hospital is clean and has everything and more you could need. In any case the only thing I would improve is a little more room and improved space for visitors. There was only one chair for visitors in a double patient room. But that is it.

I found out they were giving her psych meds and morphine, knowing she has kidney disease and can not pass meds through her system like the average person. My mom has no previous mental problems. I asked the Dr. to stop , (the only Dr. that seemed to care). He agreed and my mom got better over the next couple days. Then when she was being discharged to skilled nursing they gave her psych meds again before leaving. Now she is confused again and doesn’t know where she is. She was on floor 7.

The hospital did not provide any prior estimate for the simple service we received. After a week or so, we received a bill for over $2900 from which we have to pay over $2400. We contacted them and disputed the astronomical bill. The said it is not negotiable and we have to pay that. They charged over $2400 for ER service and said it's for administering medication and the ER bed. My wife did not use any bed and only sat on a chair. For medication administration, they gave her a couple of pills (charged separately) and a cup of water. $2400 for a cup of water and a chair?\nAfter a few weeks, we received a bill from another company called La Jolla Emergency Specialists for $868. They said this is the charge for the out-of-network doctor who was working at the ER room that night. The hospital did not mention to us that they have an out of network doctor.\nNo one should go through this again, and I highly encourage anyone who is considering this hospital, to avoid going there at all costs. They do not provide you with an estimate at the beginning and then they charge you astronomical amounts for the most simple things (remember $2400 for using a chair and a cup of water).  They do not tell you that they have out-of-network doctors and then you will receive two bills.\nTalking with them is totally useless too.

When it comes to getting admitted from the ER, what a miserable process. I had a ruptured appendix and bacterial infection. I was lied to, to be convinced to go to a much worse and more packed room, I was seen by nothing but residents (student doctors) and after countless times to speak to an Attendee (lead doctors) I was given every excuse in the world why I couldn't see them. I self-discharged myself AMA (Against medical advice) since I saw this wasn't going anywhere after almost 2 weeks of losing work, not progressing to the extent they swore I was, and no one having an answer other than blaming others. Because I left AMA, they also refused to help with pain management for my Ruptured Appendix so I left with a bag full of Antibiotics and Steroids. The nurses (literally all but one) were amazing! Sweet, charismatic, and honest. But dealing with just about everyone else was a disaster. I truly feel like the level of \"Care\" here has heavily switched from actually Caring for a Patient to Keeping the patient monitored and \"managed\" with no real desire to help them progress, and it's a shame living through it and watching other Veterans fall victim to the same.","11":"2024-09-15 15:57:14"},{"0":"2024-10-29","1":"CLOSED_PERMANENTLY","2":"Masked:222 Ndrzxjwsqj As, Adj Gxlwq, FS 55388, OAS","3":"Masked:Hxmnd Jqrkxsdq qf Adj Gxlwq","4":"Masked:FzKKuTM7dgkO5TSM8K_z-GG2PJ8","5":"3.2","6":"26","7":"Masked:Sdnlj Mqrdqlr","8":"Masked:zsskr://fff.wqqwql.uqp/pdkr/uqjsnxm/332822828878525788885/nldxlfr","9":"1","10":"Surreal, bizzare, Daliesque.\nRun as fast as you can!!! This is NOT a hospital. It's an acute care facility. Very different. I was there a week recovering from cancer surgery. Most of the nurses were great. Unfortunately, they have to work 12-hour days and are severely understaffed. It would've been great if someone had changed my bed the week I was there. But, no one did. One day my whole floor had only 2 RNs and 1 CNA!\n\nI was on a feeding tube, so I can't tell you about the food. But, I can tell you that somehow \"Diabetic\" was added to my chart even though I'm not diabetic. They put me through finger sticks every 4 hours anyway, and eventually realized I'm not diabetic just about the time I was transferred to another facility.\n\nThere was an oncologist who did his rounds after 11 PM. Awesome! I called him the Vampire of Vibra. And for some reason a pulmonologist visited everyday even though nothing was wrong with my lungs. He never examined me,  just asked how I was and billed my insurance.\n\nThere was one wonderful thing about Vibra. Their psychologist, Dr Yates is amazing. I love Dr Yates. He kept me sane by visiting me every single weekday.\n\nI almost forgot about Dr Brace. He was my attending physician while I was there. He's tall, dark, and handsome AND from Italy. Is he a good doctor? I think so. I just stared at him most of the time. It was hard to pay attention to what he said. Gorgeous!\n\nIf it weren't for Drs Yates and Brace (and this rating system), I would've given the place a 0.","11":"2017-07-30 04:24:58"},{"0":"2024-10-29","1":"CLOSED_PERMANENTLY","2":"Masked:222 Ndrzxjwsqj As, Adj Gxlwq, FS 55388, OAS","3":"Masked:Hxmnd Jqrkxsdq qf Adj Gxlwq","4":"Masked:FzKKuTM7dgkO5TSM8K_z-GG2PJ8","5":"3.2","6":"26","7":"Masked:Fnrdj Ilnnxss","8":"Masked:zsskr://fff.wqqwql.uqp/pdkr/uqjsnxm/338287858522522288635/nldxlfr","9":"5","10":"Although my precious husband finally succumbed to a last heart attack at a nursing home in La Mesa, his prior care at Vibra Hospital was the best I had ever seen.
